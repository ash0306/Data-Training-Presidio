## Git and CI/CD Pipeline

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects, manage code changes, and keep a history of every change made. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously, tracks modifications, and helps merge changes efficiently. With Git, you can:

- **Track Changes:** Monitor every update to your code, who made it, and why.
- **Collaborate Easily:** Work with others on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
- **Revert Changes:** Go back to previous versions of your code if needed.

Git is widely used in software development and is the foundation for many collaborative workflows.

### CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It helps ensure that software is always in a releasable state, improving code quality and reducing the time to market. Here's how it works:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically builds and tests code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This helps identify bugs early and ensures that new code integrates smoothly with existing code.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automates the deployment of code to production or other environments once it passes all tests. This ensures that the latest version of the software is always available to users.
