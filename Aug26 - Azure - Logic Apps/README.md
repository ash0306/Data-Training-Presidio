# Azure Logic Apps

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an Azure Data Factory pipeline that performs a specific activity and sends a success or failure email notification using Azure Logic Apps.

## Workflow

## Step 1: Create Azure Data Factory

1. **Log in to Azure Portal**:
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. **Create a New Data Factory**:

   - Navigate to **"Create a resource"** > **"Data + Analytics"** > **"Data Factory"**.
   - Provide a name for your Data Factory, choose a resource group, and select the region.
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"** to deploy your Data Factory.

3. **Launch the Data Factory Studio**:
   - Once your Data Factory is created, click **"Go to resource"** and then click **"Author & Monitor"** to open the Data Factory Studio.

## Step 2: Create a Pipeline in Data Factory

1. **Create a New Pipeline**:

   - In the Data Factory Studio, go to the **"Author"** tab and click on **"Pipelines"**.
   - Click **"New pipeline"** to create a new pipeline.

2. **Add Activities to the Pipeline**:

   - Add the activities you need in your pipeline. This could be data transformation, copy activity, etc.
   - For example, you can use the **Copy Data** activity to copy data from one source to another.

3. **Configure the Activities**:
   - Configure the source, destination, and any other necessary properties for your activities.

## Step 3: Create Logic Apps for Success and Failure Notifications

1. **Create a New Logic App**:

   - Navigate to **"Create a resource"** > **"Integration"** > **"Logic App"**.
   - Provide a name for your Logic App, choose a resource group, and select the region.
   - Click **"Review + create"** and then **"Create"** to deploy your Logic App.

2. **Design the Success Notification Logic App**:

   - Open the Logic App Designer and select **"When an HTTP request is received"** as the trigger.
   - Add an action to send an email using the **"Send an email (V2)"** action from the Office 365 Outlook connector.
   - Configure the email details, including the recipient, subject, and body, indicating the success of the activity.

3. **Design the Failure Notification Logic App**:

   - Repeat the steps above to create another Logic App for failure notification.
   - Configure the email to indicate the failure of the activity.

4. **Copy the HTTP POST URL**:
   - After saving each Logic App, copy the **HTTP POST URL** provided by the **"When an HTTP request is received"** trigger.

## Step 4: Integrate Logic Apps with Data Factory

1. **Add Web Activity in Data Factory Pipeline**:

   - In your Data Factory pipeline, drag and drop a **"Web"** activity after your main activity (e.g., Copy Data activity).
   - Configure the **"Web"** activity to use the **HTTP POST URL** from the Logic App for success.

2. **Add Failure Web Activity**:

   - Add another **"Web"** activity for failure notification.
   - Configure the **HTTP POST URL** with the URL from the failure Logic App.

3. **Set the Success and Failure Conditions**:
   - In the pipeline, configure the **success** condition to trigger the **success** Logic App's web activity.
   - Configure the **failure** condition to trigger the **failure** Logic App's web activity.

## Step 5: Testing the Setup

1. **Trigger the Pipeline**:

   - Run the pipeline in Data Factory and monitor its execution.

2. **Check Email Notifications**:
   - Upon successful execution of the activity, you should receive a success email.
   - If the activity fails, a failure email should be sent.

## Other Use Cases

1. **Automating Document Approval**: Automatically route documents for approval using SharePoint and send notifications through Microsoft Teams. Example: Approving a contract document across multiple departments.

2. **Social Media Monitoring**: Track brand mentions on Twitter and analyze sentiment using Azure Cognitive Services. Example: Identifying and responding to negative tweets about your product.

3. **Incident Management**: Automatically create and update IT tickets in ServiceNow when system issues are detected by Azure Monitor. Example: Handling server downtime alerts.

4. **Data Synchronization**: Keep Salesforce and SAP data in sync by updating records in one system when changes are detected in the other. Example: Syncing customer information between CRM and ERP systems.

5. **HR Onboarding Automation**: Automatically set up new employee accounts and notify relevant departments. Example: Creating email accounts and scheduling training for new hires.

These use cases demonstrate the versatility of Azure Logic Apps in automating and integrating a wide range of business processes.
